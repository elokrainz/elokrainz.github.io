#### Control Center

#### Multitasking

Multitasking on the iPhone is simpler than ever in iOS 7. All it takes is a 
double-tap of the Home button to preview and switch between the apps you have 
running, and a single swipe to terminate the ones you are no longer using.

#### Photos

The photo application bundled with iOS 7 now uses EXIF data recorded in each 
picture to sort by date and location, making it easy to search for a specific 
shot or event.



### THE BAD

<p class="has-pullquote" data-pullquote="What makes iOS 7 ugly is the degree to which it fails to innovate, to present something new.">
Apple has elected to stick to its recent trend of short-term, visual stunners 
instead of the product revolution it used to be known for. The company appears 
to be struggling to keep its existing user-base satisfied in an emerging world 
of cheaper, more feature-rich options. And this trend doesn't just apply to 
the iOS line, if the new iPhone models and the Mac OS X Mavericks preview are 
any indication.</p>
